# Git Workflow

A popular and well-known branching model and strategy with a little tweak is used in BlissLauncher.
[Click here to read more about the original git branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)

## Main Branches

At the very core, BlissLauncher have two main branches with infinite lifetime:

- `master`
- `dev`

We consider `origin/master` to be the main branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a
production-ready state.

We consider `origin/dev` to be the main branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a state
with the latest delivered development changes for the next release.

When the source code in the dev branch reaches a stable point and is ready to be released, all of
the changes should be merged back into master somehow and then tagged with a release number.

## Support Branches

- `Feature branches`
- `Hotfix branches`

We don't use release branches separately to simplify the deployment process for our dev team. *
That's the only difference, this model has as compare to original model.*

### Feature Branches

Must branch off from: `dev`

Must merge back into: `dev`

Branch naming convention: anything except master, develop, hotfix-*
(preferable `feature-*`)

#### Steps for working on features

When starting work on a new feature, branch off from the `dev` branch.

```sh
$ git checkout -b feature-blur-background dev
# Switched to a new branch "feature-blur-background"
```

Finished features may be merged into the develop branch to definitely add them to the upcoming
release:

```sh
git checkout dev
# Switched to branch "dev"
$ git merge --no-ff feature-blur-background
# Updating ea1b82a..05e9557
# (Summary of changes)
$ git branch -d feature-blur-background
Deleted branch feature-blur-background (was 05e9557).
$ git push origin dev
```

### Hotfix Branches

Must branch off from: `master`

Must merge back into: `master` and `dev`

Branch naming convention: `hotfix-*`

#### Steps for working on hotfixes

Hotfix branches are created from the master branch. As soon as, a hotfix branch is created, version
must be bumped using the command in the root of the project `bump-version.sh patch`

```sh
$ git checkout -b hotfix-1.2.1 master
# Switched to a new branch "hotfix-1.2.1"
$ ./bump-version.sh patch 
```

Then, fix the bug and commit the fix in one or more separate commits.

```sh
$ git commit -m "Fixed severe production problem"
# [hotfix-1.2.1 abbe5d6] Fixed severe production problem
# 5 files changed, 32 insertions(+), 17 deletions(-)
```

When finished, the bugfix needs to be merged back into master, but also needs to be merged back into
dev, in order to safeguard that the bugfix is included in the next release as well. Use
`tag-version.sh` for tagging on master branch.

```sh
$ git checkout master
# Switched to branch 'master'
$ git merge --no-ff hotfix-1.2.1
# Merge made by recursive.
# (Summary of changes)
$ ./tag-version.sh

$ git checkout dev
# Switched to branch 'dev'
$ git merge --no-ff hotfix-1.2.1
# Merge made by recursive.
# (Summary of changes)
```

Finally, remove the temporary branch:

```sh
$ git branch -d hotfix-1.2.1
Deleted branch hotfix-1.2.1 (was abbe5d6).
```

### Prepare Release

Whenever all the features that are targeted for the release-to-be-built are merged into the dev and
we are ready to prepare a test-release build, version must be bumped by using the
command `bump-version.sh
[major | minor]` based on the changes in the feature. If the test-release works without problem and
bugs are fixed for this release, we are ready to release and move this code into `master`.

#### Steps for finishing a release

First, the `dev` is merged into `master` (since every commit on master is a new release by
definition, remember). Next, that commit on master must be tagged for easy future reference to this
historical version. Use
`tag-version.sh` for tagging on master branch.

```sh
$ git checkout master
# Switched to branch 'master'
$ git merge --no-ff dev
# Merge made by recursive.
# (Summary of changes)
$ git push origin master
$ ./tag-version.sh
```

# Versioning

Semantic Versioning is used for BlissLauncher that is every version is named as major.minor.patch.
For proper versioning, one MUST use the
`bump-version.sh` every-time a new hotfix branch is created or intended features have been merged
into dev branch and are ready to be released in production. After merging into the
master, `tag-version.sh` MUST be used to tag the release version at the latest commit.

> Notes - `bump-version.sh` will and must execute only on **dev** and
> **hotfix\*** branches while `tag-version.sh` will and must only work
> on **master** branch.
